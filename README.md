# Nessus Agent Deployment Scripts

## Overview
A set of scripts for deploying a Nessus Agent for various operating systems. The scripts automate the process of downloading, installing, and linking a Nessus Agent to a remote Nessus Manager installation, provided that the endpoint on which the script is run can communicate with it. They also clean up previous installations, helping to remediate common issues with linking after reinstallation.

The scripts can be modified to work with an MDM solution for mass deployment.
